# Welcome to my profile!

Hello, I am HipsterDave! I mostly make things with `python`. 

Currently, I am working on a game called [The Legend of Talera](https://github.com/HipsterDave/The-Legend-of-Talera). It's pretty cool!

Also, I work on a repository called [Crabot](https://github.com/Crab-Robotics/Crabot). I runs a LEGO Mindstorms robot with python!
